**iReklamo** is a full-stack complaint management web application built with React.js for the frontend, Flask for the backend API, Supabase Bucket for image storing, and PostgreSQL for authentication and storage.
The project aims to provide a centralized platform for filing, tracking, and managing complaints efficiently for all the barangays across Iligan City.
The frontend interface of this project aims to mock the original iligan.gov.ph website's interface and follow its design closely to match it together.
